Backend Engineer Hiring Assessment

Build a Mood detection service from audio files. The goal is to build two services:

    Service to store an audio file in a cloud storage like Azure Blob Store.

    Service to retrieve the mood from the input audio file provided above.

Please write the service code in the language of your choice (though Python is preferred) and explain the architecture components you would want to use.

The audio should be return one of 3 different moods: 1) Happy 2) Sad 3) Calm. The actual mood does not need to be implemented; you can have a random mood generator coming back based on the time of the day. The input file could be a wav or mp3 file with sound not more than 30 secs.

The Services can be tested from the Developer console and do not need to create an API. The items that we are looking to evaluate on are:

    Code for the Service.

    Storage Design of the database

    Cloud services we are using to build

Please feel free to reach out for any clarification or for sample data.
